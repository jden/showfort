-read/unread status for comments/threads
-- (since these are linear, we can store it as a last-read timestamp in an object keyed on the objectid of the thread on the user document. then to get read status, query for the last read timestamp and check if a given comment is new than that timestamp. update the last-read time when the user views the comments)
