Showfort was a mobile-accessible, customizable guidebook to Boise's greatest independent music festival. Created over a series of sleepless nights in 2013, it attracted hundreds of users as a surperior alternative to the official native schedule applications.

Showfort was based around community, and had features to see and comment on popular bands, share your planned schedule with friends, and filter based on time and venue.

An active community grew around its [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/showfortapp) and on the ground at the festival as attendees shared the resource with each other.
